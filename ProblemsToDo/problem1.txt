Problem Description
You are planning a trip to visit N tourist attractions. The attractions are numbered from 1 to N and
must be visited in this order. You can visit at most K attractions per day, and want to plan the trip
to take the fewest number of days as possible.
Under these constraints, you want to find a schedule that has a nice balance between the attractions
visited each day. To be precise, we assign a score ai
to attraction i. Given a schedule, each day is
given a score equal to the maximum score of all attractions visited that day. Finally, the scores of
each day are summed to give the total score of the schedule. What is the maximum possible total
score of the schedule, using the fewest days possible?

Input Specification
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K (1 = K = N = 106).
The next line contains N space separated integers ai (1 = ai = 109).
For 3 of the 15 available marks, 2K = N.
For an additional 3 of the 15 available marks, K = 100 and N = 105.

Output Specification
Output a single integer, the maximum possible total score.

Sample Input
5 3
2 5 7 1 4

Output for Sample Input
12

Explanation of Output for Sample Input
We need to have at least two days to visit all the attractions, since we cannot visit all attractions in
one day.
Visiting the first two attractions on day 1 will give a score of 5, and visiting the last three attractions
on day 2 will give a score of 7, for a total score of 12.
Visiting three attractions on day 1, and two attractions on day 2, which is the only possibility to
visit in the fewest number of days possible, would yield a total score of 7 + 4 = 11.
